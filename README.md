- Visualizes my submission activity over the past year. Hotter colors mean more problems solved that day—great for spotting consistency!

### Recent Activity Feed

- Lists my latest solved problems with links. Perfect for seeing what I'm working on right now.

### Alternative Stats Card (Vercel Style)
![Gautam’s LeetCode Stats](https://leetcode-stats.vercel.app/api?username=GautamKumar_code&theme=Dark)

- A compact card with acceptance rate, ranking, and pie-like difficulty distribution (via counts).

For light mode, swap `theme=dark` to `theme=light` in the URLs. Customize fonts or add borders via parameters (e.g., `&border=2&radius=10`).

If you want more charts (e.g., pie for difficulties or bar for submissions), set up the github-leetcode-stats action:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your LeetCode username to config.
3. Enable workflows—it'll auto-generate and commit SVG charts to your README.

This setup is dynamic, mobile-friendly, and stands out—way better than static images!
